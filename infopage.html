	<title>WHY?</title>

	<h1 class="info-header">why are u dressing me up?</h1>

	<p class="info-p">when i was a child, i used to play dress-up games i found on the internet. 
my grandparents had a chunky grey desktop in the back corner of the living room, where i spent hours playing these games
it was not only a matter of picking pretty clothes. in some of these games, u have to clear acne, shave, work the character out, and only then pick an outfit.
it’s bad enough that most girls think they’re fat and ugly and i was no different.<br>
did these games help combat that? no. but oh my god were they fun ….
<br>
i mean it’s awful, seeing a crazy skinny pixel girl and thinking u need to try to look like that when she doesn’t even exist.
but when did u as a little girl see girls in video games on that big gray block? never
they were only in these dress-up games. 
it was nice to have games that aligned with my interest in fashion, it changed my life as a 6-year-old.
<br>
but i’m not a supermodel and neither are u (maybe?)
so here is my real-life dress-up game, where u dress me, 
a real girl, with her real clothes. 
and pls don’t pop my pimples, just pick my shirt thank u.</p>
